### 1. Research Question

I want to investigate how users interact with live streams and identify key metrics that I can turn into actionable steps. I would like to integrate this into my streaming workflow as well, so I can have a heartbeat on what is going on in the stream.

### 2. Measurable Indicators of Stream Growth

To assess stream growth, I will look at some key metrics:

- **Viewer Count**: Tracks the number of concurrent viewers, indicating reach and popularity.
- **User Interactions**: Includes comments, follows, and subscriptions, reflecting audience engagement.
- **Watch Hours**: Measures total viewing time, showing content consumption depth.
- **Revenue Metrics**: Such as sponsorships and ad revenue, demonstrating financial success.

### 3. Importance of the Study

Understanding these metrics is crucial because they are tied to how much money we will have to operate the stream. If I can show growth in the stream, we are more likely to get sponsorships and charge more because it is a more desirable service to prospective sponsors.

### 4. Hypothesis

The hypothesis posits that higher user engagement metrics correlate with greater stream growth. Specifically, we expect chat participation and viewer retention to be strong indicators of growth. The rationale is that active interactions suggest a dedicated audience more likely to drive long-term success than mere follower counts.

### 5. Datasets

- **Twitch Live Streaming Interactions Dataset**: This Kaggle dataset provides the user behaviors from Twitch that I can analyze and apply to other stream data.

- **Personal Stream Data**: Personal datasets will complement the Kaggle data; I will be using data that I have collected in the past to add some more context.

- [Twitch Live Streaming Interactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/volodymyrpivoshenko/twitch-live-streaming-interactions-dataset?select=full_a.csv)

I want to use this data to get some clear points that I can act on when I am live streaming.
