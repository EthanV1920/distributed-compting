Week 1 Assignment: Analyzing r/place 2022 Data
This is an individual assignment; you are not allowed to work with other students on this assignment.
Your task is to analyze the r/place 2022 data available at the following link:
2022 r/place canvas history
Links to an external site.You will write a Python script that accepts a starting and ending hour as arguments and returns:
    1    The most placed color during that timeframe.
    2    The most placed pixel location during that timeframe.
Requirements
    •    External Libraries: You are not allowed to use any external packages (nothing requiring pip install).
    •    Input Format:
    ◦    The script should accept start and end hours as command-line arguments in the following format:
YYYY-MM-DD HH (e.g., 2022-04-01 12 for April 1, 2022, at 12:00 PM).
    ◦    Ensure your script validates that the end hour is after the start hour.
    •    Color Format:
The colors in the dataset are stored as hexadecimal codes (e.g., #FFFFFF for white). You should return the most placed color in this format.
    •    Timing the Script:
Use Python's time.perf_counter_ns() or equivalent to measure execution time.
Results Documentation
In a markdown file named test_results_week_1.md, document the results of running your script with the following timeframes:
    1    A 1-hour timeframe.
    2    A 3-hour timeframe.
    3    A 6-hour timeframe.
You can pick any timeframes as long as the timeframe is entirely within the results of the r/place data.
For each timeframe, include:
    •    The selected timeframe.
    •    The number of milliseconds it took to compute the results.
    •    The output: the most placed color (in hex code) and the most placed pixel location (coordinates).
Submission
    1    Upload your Python script and markdown results file to a GitHub repository.
    2    Include the link to the repository in your submission.
